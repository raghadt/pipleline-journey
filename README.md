This is a  3D interactive game that aims to teach players the concept of Pipelining
architecture. 

The game consists of 5 trains (blue, red, pink, yellow, purple), each representing a different instruction. 
After each train (instruction) appears has to go through the 5 cycles of instruction execution. 
The train appearing represents the fetch cycle, then the instruction would have to go to the registers for the decode cycle then to the ALU for the Arithmetic or
Logical operations then itâ€™d go to the memory to access it, then finally writing back to the register again. 
Pipelining is an implementation technique, in which multiple instructions are overlapped in execution.
